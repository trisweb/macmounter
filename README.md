# macmounter

A light weight, scalable, python daemon that **automatically mounts** remote servers on login, and **keeps them mounted**. macmounter can be used for *any* protocol, sshfs, samba, afp, ftp, ntfs, webdav etc. 

In its current state it is written to run as a service on OS X (10.9+) out of the box, but it, _should_ be portable to any system that runs python 2.7.X. I have no plans to port it anywhere else at this time.

This tool is completely command line driven and is **not** moron friendly. For g33ks, it is a two step install, and a one step configuration per server. The logs are very verbose and should indicate any issues.

## Updates for 2022 and beyond
This is a rather simple script, but there has been one slight change to the configparser dependency for python, which appears to now only install if lowercase. The rest of the 
script continues to work as it has for years, as it is solidly engineered.

## Install

### Step 1 - Get code
```
git clone https://github.com/roubles/macmounter.git
```

### Step 2 - Install
```
cd macmounter
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Configure
Add config files in the directory ~/.macmounter/

A simple config file looks like:
```
$ cat example.conf
[example.com]
MOUNT_TEST_CMD=ls -l /Users/roubles/somelocalfolder/
PING_CMD=/sbin/ping -q -c3 -o example.com 
PRE_MOUNT_CMD=/bin/mkdir -p /Users/roubles/somelocalfolder/
MOUNT_CMD=/usr/local/bin/sshfs roubles@example.com:/someremotefolder /Users/roubles/somelocalfolder/ -oauto_cache,reconnect,volname=example
FOUND_MOUNT_CMD=/bin/echo "" | /usr/bin/mail -s "mounted example.com!" roubles@github.com

[anotherexample.com]
MOUNT_TEST_CMD=ls -l /Volumes/someotherfolder && /sbin/mount | grep -q someotherfolder
PING_CMD=/sbin/ping -q -c3 -o anotherexample.com
PRE_MOUNT_CMD=/sbin/umount -f /Volumes/someotherfolder; /bin/mkdir -p /Volumes/someotherfolder
MOUNT_CMD=/sbin/mount -t smbfs "//roubles:whatmeworry@anotherexample.com/someotherremotefolder" /Volumes/someotherfolder
FOUND_MOUNT_CMD=/bin/echo "" | /usr/bin/mail -s "mounted anotherexample.com!" roubles@github.com
```

But, it can be simpler. The simplest config only needs to specify MOUNT_CMD, though this may be inefficient.
```
[example.com]
MOUNT_CMD=/usr/local/bin/sshfs roubles@example.com:/someremotefolder /Users/prmehta/somelocalfolder/ -oauto_cache,reconnect,volname=auto

[anotherexample.com]
MOUNT_CMD=/sbin/mount -t smbfs //roubles:whatmeworry@anotherexample.com/someotherremotefolder /Volumes/someotherfolder
```

## Starting/Stopping

The macmounter service should start when it is installed. 

The macmounter service starts everytime you login, and dies everytime you log off. 

You can manually startup macmounter using the commandline:
```
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.irouble.macmounter.plist
```
or, logout and log back in.

## Quick reload configs
There may be instances where you don't want to wait for macmounters timers to kick in to perform mounts. For this,you can force it to re-attempt all mounts instantly by running:
```
$ macmounter.py --reload
```

## Logs

Detailed logs can be found here: ~/Library/Application Support/macmounter/macmounter.log

## Troubleshooting

Tail ~/Library/Application Support/macmounter/macmounter.log, it is very informative.

I find these bash aliases handy:
```
alias tailmmlogs='tail -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/macmounter/macmounter.log'
alias vimmlogs='vi ~/Library/Application\ Support/macmounter/macmounter.log'
```

## Basic example

A basic configuration example that should get you started can be found [here](https://github.com/roubles/macmounter/wiki/basic-example).

## More examples

### Testing mounts before remounting
It is prudent to test if the mount is active and functioning before blindly remounting. [These examples](https://github.com/roubles/macmounter/wiki/testing-mounts) show the various options for testing mounts.

### Multiple mounts from the same server
This is pretty straight forward, just add a section for each mount. [These examples] (https://github.com/roubles/macmounter/wiki/Mounting-multiple-folders-from-the-same-server) show examples.

### Waking up servers before mounting
Sometimes NAS boxes go to sleep when idle. [These examples](https://github.com/roubles/macmounter/wiki/wakeup-server-before-mounting) show the various options for waking up remote drives on the LAN. 

### Unmounting before mounting
If your mount test fails, it is very likely that the mount is in a weird state. It is recommended that you force an unmount before trying to remount. [These examples](https://github.com/roubles/macmounter/wiki/unmount-before-mount) show the various options for unmounting before remounting.

### Success/Failure commands
Sometimes it is desirable to run commands on success or failure. One good reason is to notify someone of the success or failure. [These examples](https://github.com/roubles/macmounter/wiki/status-notification-commands) show the various options of running commands on success or failure.

### Custom retry timers
macmounter by default uses a five minute timer to retry for every case. However, it is written to be very configurable, and you can fine tune the retry time for pretty much every state. [These examples](https://github.com/roubles/macmounter/wiki/configure-polling-intervals) show the various options for fine tuning the retry timers per state.

### Miscellaneous examples
[This](https://github.com/roubles/macmounter/wiki/Example-Configs) is a full list of example configs.

## Password management

It is not recommended to store your password in cleartext in the config files. macmounter provides simple shell scripts to use OSX's keychain to store passwords. More information is [here](https://github.com/roubles/macmounter/wiki/password-management).

## Uninstall
